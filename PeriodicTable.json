However, it was Sir Humphry Davy who recognized it as an element and named it in 1810.</p> <h2>Word Origin:</h2> <p>The name chlorine comes from the Greek word *chloros*, meaning pale green, which refers to its color. This term was chosen by Sir Humphry Davy when he officially named the element in 1810.</p> <h2>Physical Properties:</h2> <p>Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature with a strong, pungent odor. It is highly toxic and denser than air. Chlorine has a melting point of approximately -101°C and boils at -34°C.</p> <h3>Chemical Properties:</h3> <ul> <li>A strong oxidizing agent due to its tendency to readily accept electrons to complete its outer shell.</li> <li.Forms both ionic and covalent bonds with other elements, often resulting in chlorides or organic chlorinated compounds.</li> <li.Widely used in water treatment processes for disinfection purposes due to its ability to kill bacteria and other pathogens.</li> <li.Playing an important role in many industrial processes, including bleaching textiles and manufacturing plastics like PVC (polyvinyl chloride).</li> </ul>",

Although H.G. Madan is mentioned in some contexts, it was primarily Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Ramsay who identified and named this element based on its properties.</p> <h2>Physical Properties:</h2> <p>Argon is a colorless, odorless gas that makes up approximately 0.934% of Earth's atmosphere, making it the third most abundant gas after nitrogen and oxygen. It has a low boiling point of -185.85°C and is heavier than air.</p> <h3>Chemical Properties:</h3> <ul> <li>A chemically inert element due to its full outer energy level, which makes it non-reactive under normal conditions.</li> <li.Widely used in lighting applications such as incandescent bulbs and fluorescent tubes due to its ability to maintain an electric discharge without reacting with other elements.</li> <li.Importantly used in welding processes as an inert shielding gas to protect molten metal from atmospheric gases that could cause oxidation or contamination.</li> <li.Does not form natural compounds with other elements because of its stable electronic configuration.</li> </ul>",
